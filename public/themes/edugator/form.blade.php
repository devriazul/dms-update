              I understand that the Certificate and Transcript will be sent to me digitally once the course will finish if I passed all the assignments and that

              The non-refundable OTHM registration fee of Â£150 must be paid before the start of the academic term. The registration fee is a one-time fee 
              that covers the cost of processing and administration. The registration fee is non-refundable and non-transferable, regardless of the 
              circumstances. In case of cancellation of admission or withdrawal from the program, the registration fee will not be refunded. Failure to pay 
              the registration fee by the due date may result in the student being unable to enroll in the program. The registration fee must be paid in full 
              and is not eligible for installment payments </p><p>
              The institution reserves the right to make changes to the registration fee policy without prior notice.</p><p>
              By paying the non-refundable OTHM registration fee, the student agrees to these terms and conditions. The institution reserves the right to 
              take legal action against students who fail to pay the non-refundable OTHM registration fee.</p><p>Tuition fees are refundable prior to the enrollment date. To be eligible for a refund, the student must notify the institution in writing of their intention to withdraw from the program. Refunds will be processed within 30 days of receipt of the written notice. The amount of the refund will be based on the date the written notice was received, as follows:
                  <ul>
                      <li>If the written notice is received more than 30 days prior to the enrollment date, a full refund of the tuition fees will be issued.</li>
                      <li>If the written notice is received less than 30 days but more than 14 days prior to the enrollment date, a 50% refund of the tuition fees will be issued.</li>  
                      <li>If the written notice is received less than 14 days prior to the enrollment date, no refund of the tuition fees will be issued.</li>
                  </ul>
                  The institution reserves the right to make changes to the refund policy without prior notice. The refund policy applies only to tuition fees and 
                  does not include any additional fees, such as textbooks, materials, or other costs associated with the program. The institution is not 
                  responsible for any bank fees or other charges incurred as a result of the refund. The institution reserves the right to refuse a refund in cases 
                  of academic misconduct or violations of the institution's policies and procedures. </p><p>These terms and conditions are governed by the laws of England and Wales. Any disputes arising from these terms and conditions will be 
                  resolved in the courts of England and Wales.
